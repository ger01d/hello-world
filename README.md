## Usage and Tweaks
Simply run the script with python kinematics_bittle.py or kinematics_nybble.py. At first you will see a plot of the vertical and horizontal movement. After closing this window, the script will generate the joint angles, that can be directly used for the instincts.h in OpenCat.


Please make sure that you install the required packages in requirements.txt.
